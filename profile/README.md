Hello 👋, and welcome! This organization owns the source code for [Helium Edu](https://www.heliumedu.com) projects, including [Helium Student Planner's deployment infastructure](https://github.com/heliumedu/deploy), and also maintains [`helium-cli`](https://github.com/HeliumEdu/heliumcli) and Django [`template-project`](https://github.com/HeliumEdu/template-project).

Helium is free to use, and even though the development, maintenance, and direction of Helium is a group effort, I ([Alex Laird](https://github.com/alexdlaird)) am still the one writing the code, designing the features, and making sure everything feels polished and reliable.

➡ If you'd like to support this work ❤️, you can do so through [Patreon 🙌🏻](https://www.patreon.com/alexdlaird) or [PayPal 👏🏻](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/alexdlaird)—even though Helium is free, it still has operating costs.\
➡ If you need assistance with the Helium, [check out support](https://support.heliumedu.com/).
